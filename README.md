'Cross' a live data tool for migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea between Libya and Italy.

[Live] (http://cross.fromscratch.io/)

###Why
'cross' is a live data tool that lets migrants know if it is relatively safe to cross or not cross the sea between Libya and Italy.

It is constantly updated and it generates a simple outcome, ‘cross’ or do ‘not cross' based on data from UNHCR and IOM. Data analysis allows migrants to know how deadly the route has been for the current year at the present state. A risk index is generated based on how and if mortality rate is higher or lower than the historical yearly average.

It is a project that flips the common structure in data studies. While we are constantly analized over the internet, rarerly these information we produced, become tools that we can use for our decisions. Here the migrants are the data and they are also the ones using them back.
