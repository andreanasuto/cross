'Cross' a live data tool for migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea between Libya and Italy.

[Live] (http://cross.fromscratch.io/)

### Why
'cross' is a live data tool that lets migrants know if it is relatively safe to cross or not cross the sea between Libya and Italy.

It is constantly updated and it generates a simple outcome, ‘cross’ or do ‘not cross' based on data from UNHCR and IOM. Data analysis allows migrants to know how deadly the route has been for the current year at the present state. A risk index is generated based on how and if mortality rate is higher or lower than the historical yearly average.

It is a project that flips the common structure in data studies. While we are constantly analized over the internet, rarerly these information we produced, become tools that we can use for our decisions. Here the migrants are the data and they are also the ones using them back.

### What
Signals should give us timely right answers to our questions. Think about a traffic light.

Unfortunately, there’s no such a thing as the right time to cross a sea for a migrant, even if this includes make the deadliest crossing in the world. Since 2014, more than 14,000 people are dead or missing in the central Mediterranean. Despite these dramatic numbers, no data or analysis seems able to create enough awareness to stop this massacre. Over time another paradox has appeared: the analysis that come from these migrants, are not designed for them. What if migrants can use their own data?

‘cross’ oversimplified structure strikes as warning and provocation. A provocation against the simplified and post-factual narrative about what it's truly happening. A warning to the misuse of data analysis. 'cross' is call to action to converge into a compelling narrative that aims to save human lives by directly helping the migrants while raising awareness around the limits of a purely data driven public narrative.

### How
The aim of this project is not built a fully reliable decision model, it is to create awareness around the loss of human lives of the largest migration in Europe since 1945 and the recent 'zero-landing' policy applied by Italy.

Using official data available since 2014 for the central Mediterranean route, the historical yearly average mortality rate (dead or missing people/number of arrivals) has been compounded for the last three years. If the current death rate is lower than the 2014-17 average, the output is 'cross' and viceversa. The risk index is compound as how different is the real time mortality rate compared to the past in percentage. Since many factors beyond these data can make a substantial difference in the safety of the journey, we do not encourage migrants to base their decision on our data alone.
